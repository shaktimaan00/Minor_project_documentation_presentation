E-commerce is one of the fastest growing segments in the Indian Economy. Though marked by high growth rate, the Indian e-commerce industry has been behind its counterparts in many developed and emerging economies, primarily due to a relatively low internet user base. In a study conducted by global management consultancy firm AT Kearney in 2015, there were only 39 million online buyers in India; a tiny fraction of the 1.2 billion who live in the country.
This study attempts to explore the evolution of e-commerce in India and identifies various challenges to as well the factors responsible for the future growth and development of e-commerce.
